# ParkIN Terms & Conditions

ParkIN helps users to be aware of parking locations' service time (cleaning time) in Sweden.

These terms and conditions apply to the ParkIN website and app (hereby referred to as "Application", "Product", "Service") for mobile devices that were created by Vitaly Shvetsov (hereby referred to as "Service Provider", "we", "our", or "us") as a Commercial service.

The Service Provider may wish to update the Application at some point to ensure that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. The application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device.
